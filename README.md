Nonylphenol exposure project with S. purpuratus. This repository includes all scripts and raw data for analyzing development success, survival, and  morphological variation/abnormalities in three stages (blastula, gastrula and pluteus). There are also scripts and raw data for analyzing gene expression patterns in the gastrula and pluteus stages in response to nonylphenol exposure. 

Collections: We obtained adult individuals from an urchin population maintained at the University of California, Davis Bodega Marine Lab by the Aquatic Resource Group. Individuals were housed in a common garden environment at standard Bodega Bay temperatures with a flow-through sea water system for several months and fed kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) ad libitum to ensure good reproductive condition before spawning was induced (Strathmann, 1987). We collected ten adults from this larger population to ensure a high likelihood of obtaining at least four males and four females for the full experiment.
 
Spawning, Fertilization and Culture Maintenance To induce spawning, we injected 2 mL of 0.5 M KCl in the peristomal membrane tissue surrounding the Aristotle’s lantern (mouth) (Adams et al. 2019). If the individual was female, it was placed in a beaker with filtered sea water (FSW) so that eggs collected at the bottom, and if the individual was male, it was placed oral side up in a small beaker to condense and keep sperm inactive until fertilization. Once all individuals were successfully spawned, each group of eggs was washed three times in FSW. After the final wash we measured density to ensure each beaker was at 10-20 eggs/mL to decrease the risk of overcrowding (Hodin et al., 2019). Each female’s eggs were then split across four beakers, representing the control and three exposures in the study. 

We added concentrated sperm to each beaker that contained eggs, matching only one male to each female to establish four individual mate pairs, or families, with 16 beakers total. We refer to these families as mate pairs 1-4 throughout the rest of this paper. We set up each 1000 mL beaker with a stir paddle following previous methods established by Strathmann (1987) to keep larvae evenly distributed, maintain water oxygenation, and ensure optimal larval growth (Hodin et al., 2019). We cleaned beakers with a reverse filtration method detailed in Hodin et al. (2019) and refilled them with the appropriate control or nonylphenol exposure water on day 3 and day 6 of the experiment. We maintained larval cultures at 15°C and at 35 ppm salt in FSW.
 
Chemical Exposures: We examine responses to a particular urban-associated EDC, nonylphenol, which is a type of alkylphenol. Alkylphenols are a class of EDCs that are highly water soluble and used in a variety of industrial and household products, including pesticides, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. EDCs actively alter the efficacy of hormones, particularly thyroid and steroid hormones (Darbre, 2022). The Mussel Watch program, examining 87 intertidal sites for the concentration of various EDCs, found evidence of alkylphenols at all of their sites, with increasing concentrations depending on proximity to urbanization and runoff (Dodder et al., 2014; Maruya et al., 2014).  Previous research has shown that nonylphenol, a subclass of alkylphenols make up 80% of alkylphenols in sewage runoff (David et al., 2009), resulted in extremely high proportions of developmental abnormalities when oyster larvae were exposed to as little as 100µg/L (ppb) (Nice et al., 2000). Roepke et al. (2005) identified an EC50 level for an alkylphenol similar to Nonylphenol (4-octylphenol, 0.174 µg/L). Several environmental studies have been done focusing on nonylphenol concentration distributions as well, with the average concentration of nonylphenol in stormwater runoff ranging from 470ng/L (ppb) to 1,700 ng/L (ppb) in several European countries(Björklund et al., 2009; Bressy et al., 2011). Given the previous literature, the treatments I implemented included 1) Control, 2) 100ppb nonylphenol, 3) 500ppb nonylphenol and 4) 1000ppb nonylphenol. Exposure began at fertilization and was held constant throughout the study until it was ended at 7 days post-fertilization. Experimental design and data collection was done in accordance to figure 1 for each of the four mate pairs.

 Schematic for experimental design for each mate pair in this study. Males and females were spawned, and gametes were combined and placed into the four treatments: Control, 100ppb nonylphenol, 500ppb nonylphenol and 1000ppb nonylphenol. Data was then collected at the stages highlighted below, from fertilization success at 15 minutes post-fertilization to the pluteus stage at 7 days post fertilization. Exposure was constant throughout the study.
